geo_py is an open source library containing methods and functions that allow a user to easily
execute geodetic calclulations that allow them to determine distances between multiple points,
determine a location after traversing a curvelinear surface from a known point, read
in digital elevation data.  In addition, this library contains coordinate transformations
and datums.

geo_py is still in development with the Python 3.10.9 language.
